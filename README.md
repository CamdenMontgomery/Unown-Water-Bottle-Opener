# Unown (Pokémon) Water Bottle Opener

>A lightweight 3D‑printed tool designed for those with a weaker grip to easily open stubborn plastic water bottles.

## Why I Made It

I created this for my now‑wife, who often found water bottle caps painful to open. Wanting something both functional and fun, I drew inspiration from Pokémon‑themed household tools I’d seen online. Unown “A” stood out — its handle-like legs and circular center were perfect for the task. The iris aligns with the bottle cap so that when used, the cap completes the Unown’s eye.

## How I Made It

Designed in **Blender**, printed on a **Bambu Labs X1C** and an **Ender 3**, both using **PLA**. Any PLA and printer should work fine.

Early versions lacked center ridges, causing slips, so I added textured ridges for grip. After testing different orientations, I found printing it flat gave the best balance of speed, flexibility, and strength.

## What I Learned

Choosing the right Pokémon for the concept was the hardest part — Unown “A” fit perfectly. Moving the eye to the rim let the bottle cap form the iris, completing the design in use.

PLA proved ideal: rigid for the handles, flexible for the center loop. I modeled using non‑destructive edits in Blender for easy adjustments, and printed the original at 0.2 mm layer height (finer works even better).
